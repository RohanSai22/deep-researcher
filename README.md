## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.18.0 or later recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohanSai22/deep-researcher.git
   cd deep-researcher
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install or yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:
   ```env
   
    # (Optional) Server-side Gemini API Key (Required for server API calls)
    
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=
    
    # (Optional) Server API Proxy URL
    
    API_PROXY_BASE_URL=
    
    # (Optional) Server API Access Password for enhanced security
    
    ACCESS_PASSWORD=
    
    # (Optional) Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.
    
    HEAD_SCRIPTS=
   ```

**Important Notes on Environment Variables:**

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: **Optional but required for using the server-side API.** You need to obtain a Google Generative AI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). This key should be kept secret and **never committed to your public repository.**
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: **Optional.** If you need to use a proxy server for API requests, configure this variable with your proxy server's base URL. This is relevant for server-side API calls.
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: **Optional but highly recommended for server-side deployments.** Set a strong password to protect your server-side API endpoints. This password will be required to access server-side API functionalities.
- `HEAD_SCRIPTS`: **Optional** Injected script code can be used for statistics or error tracking.

**Privacy Reminder:** These environment variables are primarily used for **server-side API calls**. When using the **local API mode**, no API keys or server-side configurations are needed, further enhancing your privacy.

4. **Run the development server**:
```bash
pnpm dev  # or npm run dev or yarn dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Environment variables for server-side API configurations:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: Required for server-side API calls.
- `API_PROXY_BASE_URL`: Optional proxy server URL.
- `ACCESS_PASSWORD`: Optional password for securing server-side endpoints.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy

Your privacy is our priority. All research data and generated reports are stored locally on your machine. No data is transmitted to external servers unless explicitly using server-side API calls.
